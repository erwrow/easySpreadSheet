# easySpreadSheet
An easy to implement spreadsheet for javascript

To use this code, just copy the function "generarTablaEditable" and parse the following data to it:<br><br>
*A prefix ID.<br>
*An array of arrays (or objects) for the header.<br>
*An array of arrays (or objects) for the body.<br>
*A properties object that tells the spreadsheet how to behave.<br><br>

The properties are fixed, where the programmer can enable or diable whatever they want.
